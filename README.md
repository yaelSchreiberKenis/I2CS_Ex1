# Ex1 Polynomial Utilities — README


A collection of static methods for working with polynomials represented as arrays of doubles.

---

##  Overview

Polynomials in this assignment are represented as arrays of doubles, where index *i* corresponds to the coefficient of (x^i). For example:

```java
{3, 2, 1}  // represents 3 + 2x + x^2
```

`Ex1.java` implements methods for:

* Evaluating polynomials
* Adding, multiplying, and differentiating polynomials
* Computing area and length between curves
* Parsing polynomials from strings
* Building a polynomial from given points
* Checking equality of polynomials within EPS
* Producing string representations
